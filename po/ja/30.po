" They aim to ensure that all Debian hardware is no more than 5 years old\n"
" at any one time and hope to improve Debian donations and financial\n"
" contributions in order to support that. They are moving towards using\n"
" virtual machines for most services, consolidating our hosting locations\n"
" and adding disaster mitigation through geographically-distributed service\n"
" redundancy. They are starting a new Debian CDN for the distribution of\n"
" static content such as the Debian website and Planet Debian. They have\n"
" recently deployed a SSO solution for debian.org web based services. They\n"
" will also be locking inactive shell accounts and adding easy ways to\n"
