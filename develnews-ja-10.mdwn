PTS news
--------

 The PTS has been improved to show/aggregate some new info:

 1. The integration with lintian has been improved. The hyperlink to the
 Lintian report is now shown only if Lintian has something "to say" about
 that package. Moreover, if there were warnings or errors in the last
 Lintian ran, they are now shown as TODO items in the appropriate part of
 the PTS web interface.

 2. The availability of uploads on mentors.d.n waiting for sponsorships
 are now shown as TODO items.

 3. help and gift tags are now shown: the formers as problems in need of
 help, the latters in the bug box, with a hyperlink to explain gift tag
 semantics (see http://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org/GiftTag).
 
 All pages are now (hopefully) valid XHTML 1.0 Strict, this not only
 improves accessibility, but also enables XML-based post-processing of
 pages.

 A lot of bugs have been squashed during DebConf8, you might want to look
 at the PTS bug page to check the status of bugs you reported.

Personnel changes
-----------------

 Martin Zobel-Helas joined the DSA team and therefore will reduce his
 involvement with Stable Release Management, though he is still available
 as a Stable Release Wizard. His role as a Stable Release Manager has been
 taken up by Philipp Kern, who was a Stable Release Assistant formerly.

Delayed queue moves to ravel
----------------------------

 people.debian.org will move to ravel.debian.org in near future, thus the
 delayed queue[1] will move as well. At this occasion, we decided to move
 it to /org/delayed.d.o, and add a canonical upload host
 ssh-delayed.upload.debian.org. Now the upload tools need to be adjusted.

Git user survey 2008
--------------------

 The git developers have asked us to help them advertize their new user
 survey. If you're using Git, consider taking a few minutes to answer this
 survey[2].
