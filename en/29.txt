New Iceweasel add-on to help looking up developer sites
-------------------------------------------------------

 A new Firefox/Iceweasel add-on Debian buttons[1] was packaged by Tanguy
 Ortolo[2]. The add-on makes available several toolbar buttons that can be
 used to quickly lookup information in the BTS, PTS, packages.debian.org,
 mailing list archive, DDPO, Build daemon logs and the security tracker.
 The keyword for the lookup is taken from the clipboard, so no keyboard is
 required.

Realtime collaborative text editing services for Debian
-------------------------------------------------------

 There are now a number of realtime collaborative text editing services
 for Debian available. Stefano Zacchiroli reported[3] that there is now a
 Titanpad instance for Debian[4] (web-based). In addition there is a
 Mobwrite instance for Debian[5] (also web-based), which provides a
 simpler, text-only interface. For those who prefer not to use
 JavaScript-based applications, `gobby.debian.org` is now up and
 running[6], you will need to install gobby-0.5[7] and run `gobby-0.5` to
 access it. Both Titanpad and Gobby also have integrated chat systems.
 Both Titanpad/Etherpad and Mobwrite are not yet packaged for Debian.

DEP9: Availability of reconf-inetd (replacement of update-inetd)
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Maintainers of packages that provide services that

  * require separate inetd.conf entries for ipv4/ipv6 versions
  * have more than one implementation in the archive (eg. proftpd vs
    ftpd-ssl)

 Are encouraged to test their packages with reconf-inetd, currently in
 unstable. For details see the announcement in debian-devel[8].

Security tracker improvements
-----------------------------

 The Debian security issue tracker[9] now links to the corresponding
 Ubuntu and Gentoo security issue pages for each CVE. It also links to a
 list of security issue trackers for other distributions. Also in
 development[10] is a per-maintainer page listing public security issues
 in all of a maintainer's packages.

Derivatives census improvements
-------------------------------

 The data generated by the derivatives census is now[11] updated on a
 daily basis, including patches[12] between Debian and derivatives with
 deb-src entries in their sources.list. If you are a maintainer of source
 packages in Debian and you have some spare time on your hands, you might
 want to look at the patches for your source packages and determine if
 they are useful for Debian. In many cases the patches will not be useful
 (such as the empty or changelog-only ones). Future work may involve
 creating an interface to the patches data to allow individual maintainers
 to filter out uninteresting patches, mark useful ones as merged etc. Help
 on any aspect of this project is extremely welcome. Thanks go to DSA,
 Peter Palfrader and Steve McIntyre. Peter implemented
 `snapshot.debian.org` two years ago, which the patch generation relies
 on. Steve hosted the 2011 Debian UK BBQ weekend, where most of the
 details of the patch generation were hammered out.

mentors.d.n software upgrade
----------------------------

 Arno TÃ¶ll reported[13] that mentors.debian.net has been upgraded to
 debexpo 2.0 (the "Welcome Nicolas Dandrimont release"). Due to database
 changes, the existing comments and package subscriptions were temporarily
 removed from the database. The QA plugin infrastructure had a major
 overhaul, with better output and having machine-readable backend data.
 Packages are now automatically removed when they reach Debian or when
 they did not find a sponsor for 12 weeks. All uploads are verified using
 OpenPGP keys instead of the previous method. The website also now
 supports HTTPS to prevent leaking passwords and session cookies. Several
 annoying bugs (including the orig.tar.gz overwrite bug) were fixed.
 Thanks to the cleanup done with this upgrade, future updates will be
 quicker and easier.

Support for the copyright format 1.0 (developed as DEP 5)
---------------------------------------------------------

 Version 1.0[14] of the machine-readable format for Debian copyright files
 (the culmination of the DEP 5[15] process) has been published[16]
 following the release of the version 3.9.3[17] of the Debian policy. In
 parallel, Lintian has been updated to version 2.5.5[18], which has an
 extensive support for the machine-readable format and its version 1.0 URL
 in its tags[19]. The machine-readable format can be generated by hand or
 with helpers, such as licensecheck2dep5[20], or Config::Model[21], for
 which a new command-line interface, cme[22], has been released recently.
