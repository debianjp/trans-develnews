~/.ssh/authorized_keys will remain disabled by default
------------------------------------------------------

 Peter Palfrader announced on debian-infrastructure-announce[1] that DSA
 will not reenable the usage of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. One should use the
 official LDAP infrastructure[2] to setup key-based SSH connection to
 debian.org machines. There's an exception however, quoting Peter:

> Should you need keys only on specific hosts for automated tasks like
> updating stuff or syncing files between project machines or similar
> we can enable a user editable authorized_keys file for specific users
> on specific hosts.  Usually we would expect those keys to be limited
> to use only from certain hosts (using from="<xyz>") and limited to
> allow execution of only certain commands (using command="<foobar").
> Contact DSA if you have such a case.

Minor update to the mailing list code of conduct
------------------------------------------------

 The code of conduct[3] that applies to Debian mailing lists has been
 slightly updated. People who receive unwanted private copies of public
 answers are asked to not complain publicly about that fact. Instead they
 should mail privately the offender.

Document aimed at upstreams in preparation
------------------------------------------

 In order to have a single resource for upstream developers to read up on
 the needs of distributors, a page has been started inside the Debian Wiki
 at http://wiki.debian.org/GettingPackaged. Help is requested from
 framework maintainers (programming languages, application servers, build
 systems, ...) to document best practices for components inside that
 framework (e.g. "python modules should use distutils").

d-i beta2 in preparation, breaks beta 1
---------------------------------------

 Preparations have begun for the beta 2 release of Debian Installer for
 Lenny. The changes to the Debian archive are known to break some
 installation media from the lenny beta 1 release.

 Affected are images that load installer components from a network
 mirror (netboot, mini.iso and floppy). Please use daily built
 images instead.

New "transition check" tool
---------------------------

 In version 2.10.27, the devscripts package introduced a new tool named
 "transition-check".

 The tool can be used to determine whether a package (or set of packages)
 are involved in a transition for which the Release Team have currently
 blocked uploads to unstable.
