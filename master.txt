New Iceweasel add-on to help looking up developer sites
-------------------------------------------------------

 A new Firefox/Iceweasel add-on Debian buttons[1] was packaged by Tanguy
 Ortolo[2]. The add-on makes available several toolbar buttons that can be
 used to quickly lookup information in the BTS, PTS, packages.debian.org,
 mailing list archive, DDPO, Build daemon logs and the security tracker.
 The keyword for the lookup is taken from the clipboard, so no keyboard is
 required.

Realtime collaborative text editing services for Debian
-------------------------------------------------------

 There are now a number of realtime collaborative text editing services
 for Debian available. Stefano Zacchiroli reported[3] that there is now a
 Titanpad instance for Debian[4] (web-based). In addition there is a
 Mobwrite instance for Debian[5] (also web-based), which provides a
 simpler, text-only interface. For those who prefer not to use
 JavaScript-based applications, `gobby.debian.org` is now up and
 running[6], you will need to install gobby-0.5[7] and run `gobby-0.5` to
 access it. Both Titanpad and Gobby also have integrated chat systems.
 Both Titanpad/Etherpad and Mobwrite are not yet packaged for Debian.

DEP9: Availability of reconf-inetd (replacement of update-inetd)
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Maintainers of packages that provide services that

  * require separate inetd.conf entries for ipv4/ipv6 versions
  * have more than one implementation in the archive (eg. proftpd vs
    ftpd-ssl)

 Are encouraged to test their packages with reconf-inetd, currently in
 unstable. For details see the announcement in debian-devel[8].

Security tracker improvements
-----------------------------

 The Debian security issue tracker[9] now links to the corresponding
 Ubuntu and Gentoo security issue pages for each CVE. It also links to a
 list of security issue trackers for other distributions. Also in
 development[10] is a per-maintainer page listing public security issues
 in all of a maintainer's packages.

Derivatives census improvements
-------------------------------

 The data generated by the derivatives census is now[11] updated on a
 daily basis, including patches[12] between Debian and derivatives with
 deb-src entries in their sources.list. If you are a maintainer of source
 packages in Debian and you have some spare time on your hands, you might
 want to look at the patches for your source packages and determine if
 they are useful for Debian. In many cases the patches will not be useful
 (such as the empty or changelog-only ones). Future work may involve
 creating an interface to the patches data to allow individual maintainers
 to filter out uninteresting patches, mark useful ones as merged etc. Help
 on any aspect of this project is extremely welcome. Thanks go to DSA,
 Peter Palfrader and Steve McIntyre. Peter implemented
 `snapshot.debian.org` two years ago, which the patch generation relies
 on. Steve hosted the 2011 Debian UK BBQ weekend, where most of the
 details of the patch generation were hammered out.

mentors.d.n software upgrade
----------------------------

 Arno TÃ¶ll reported[13] that mentors.debian.net has been upgraded to
 debexpo 2.0 (the "Welcome Nicolas Dandrimont release"). Due to database
 changes, the existing comments and package subscriptions were temporarily
 removed from the database. The QA plugin infrastructure had a major
 overhaul, with better output and having machine-readable backend data.
 Packages are now automatically removed when they reach Debian or when
 they did not find a sponsor for 12 weeks. All uploads are verified using
 OpenPGP keys instead of the previous method. The website also now
 supports HTTPS to prevent leaking passwords and session cookies. Several
 annoying bugs (including the orig.tar.gz overwrite bug) were fixed.
 Thanks to the cleanup done with this upgrade, future updates will be
 quicker and easier.

Support for the copyright format 1.0 (developed as DEP 5)
---------------------------------------------------------

 Version 1.0[14] of the machine-readable format for Debian copyright files
 (the culmination of the DEP 5[15] process) has been published[16]
 following the release of the version 3.9.3[17] of the Debian policy. In
 parallel, Lintian has been updated to version 2.5.5[18], which has an
 extensive support for the machine-readable format and its version 1.0 URL
 in its tags[19]. The machine-readable format can be generated by hand or
 with helpers, such as licensecheck2dep5[20], or Config::Model[21], for
 which a new command-line interface, cme[22], has been released recently.

Report from DSA Team Sprint
---------------------------

 The Debian System Administrators met for a sprint in Oslo, Norway. Luca
 Filipozzi sent a report[1] about their activities at the sprint. The
 goals of the meeting were to develop a long term plan for Debian's
 infrastructure, to review the current set of machines we maintain and the
 services we provide, and to formulate some policies and procedures
 regarding account and group management.

 They aim to ensure that all Debian hardware is no more than 5 years old
 at any one time and hope to improve Debian donations and financial
 contributions in order to support that. They are moving towards using
 virtual machines for most services, consolidating our hosting locations
 and adding disaster mitigation through geographically-distributed service
 redundancy. They are starting a new Debian CDN for the distribution of
 static content such as the Debian website and Planet Debian. They have
 recently deployed a SSO solution for debian.org web based services. They
 will also be locking inactive shell accounts and adding easy ways to
 unlock them and monitoring the use of group memberships.

Using RAM for temporary files ?
-------------------------------

 As a result of ground work to use virtual filesystems for some
 directories containing temporary files, it is easier to mount /tmp on
 tmpfs. A long discussion about the default location (on RAM or on disk)
 took place on the debian-devel mailing list, which is summarised in a
 couple of posts and on LWN.

 - Final decision on defaulting to disk:

Control Commands at submit@bugs.debian.org time
-----------------------------------------------

 You can now use control commands at submit@bugs.debian.org time in the
 pseudo-headers. An example is the following:

 Package: foo
 Severity: normal
 Control: retitle -1 a bug, a bug, a buggy bug
 Control: tag -1 moreinfo help

 See pseudo header control commands[2], my blog post[3], and the
 DebConf12 lighting talk[4] for more information.

Debian Maintainer Dashboard
---------------------------

 Debian Maintainer Dashboard[5] aims at gathering various kind of
 information useful to maintainers and teams. In addition to the usual
 information about packages versions, bug counts, etc., it exposes a list
 of TODO items (RC bugs to fix, missing builds, testing migration issues,
 new upstream releases etc). DMD gets all the data from the Ultimate Debian
 Database.

Declaring media (MIME) types with FreeDesktop menu entry files
--------------------------------------------------------------

 The package mime-support version 3.53~experimental1[6] was uploaded in
 experimental. It implements the parsing of .desktop files to generate
 mailcap entries, thanks to a patch[7] from Brian M. Carlson. This will
 allow to de-duplicate media type information in packages containing
 FreeDesktop menu entry files.

amd64 most popular architecture according to popcon
---------------------------------------------------

 Today, amd64 is the architecture with the greatest number of popcon[1]
 submissions by a narrow margin. When restricted to submissions from
 squeeze users, amd64 has 51% of all submissions and i386 47%.

Register your media types to the IANA
-------------------------------------

 Please consider registering media types to the IANA before requiring
 their inclusion in the mime-support[2] package. Simplified registration
 procedures for vendor and personal trees are being implemented with the
 update of RFC 4288[3], that states: ''it should rarely, if ever, be
 necessary to use unregistered types. Therefore, use of types in the "x."
 tree is strongly discouraged.'' Charles Plessy has confirmed that the
 process is fairly quick and painless by registering
 text/vnd.debian.copyright[4] for machine-readable Debian copyright files.

First release of dput-ng in unstable
------------------------------------

 As seen on debian-devel[5], dput-ng has been uploaded to unstable. Please
 feel free to test it, and provide early feedback on it. dput-ng is a
 from-scratch rewrite of dput that provides an identical interface for
 dput, and a slightly modified one for dcut (since most of us had to look
 up the manpage anyway). It supports the new DM permissions, and allows
 for more complex hooks to be written to be run before or after an upload.

Recent changes on the Debian QA front
-------------------------------------

 The PTS gained knowledge of the new system for DM access controls and of
 upstream URLs that are failing, via the Debian Url ChecKer[6]. The PTS
 had various watch-file related improvements, please check your PTS pages
 before uploading so you can include new/updated watch files. The PTS now
 reports when direct dependencies need a new maintainer. The PTS gained
 semantic information using RDF files.

 The Debian QA infrastructure always needs more folks working on it, so if
 you have some spare time, please check out the code and come join us on
 the debian-qa mailing list and IRC channel.

Fancy graphs on lintian.d.o
---------------------------

 Lintian.d.o now displays graphs over historical data collected for
 each tag (like[7] these[8]).
 Full credits goes to JordÃ  Polo for writing the data collection, graph
 generation and even updating the templates to show the graphs inline!

 Besides the graphs, we are also pleased to announce two other great
 changes! First off, it is now possible to mechanically request the
 report for a given source package (without knowing its maintainer) by
 accessing:

  `http://lintian.debian.org/source/<src>[/<src-version>]`

 Currently this just redirects to the maintainer's lintian report.
 Secondly, we have extended Lintian's work schedule to include i386
 experimental! Thus, you may now see multiple reports for the same
 source package on your lintian page.
